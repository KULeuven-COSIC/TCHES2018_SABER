This repository contains the ARM Cortex-M0 and M4 code for SABER implementing the optimizations described in [eprint2018 - 682](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/682.pdf)

**Note:** This code is an updated version that introduces little modifications in the rounding algorithm, which lead to small (mostly negligible) differences in the cycle count of the operations with respect to the results reported in the paper

**Note 2:** The code provided in this repository is NOT the most up-to-date implementation of Saber, subsequent works have improved Saber, as can be seen in [another repository](https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/TCHES2020_SABER), and including the official repository of the Saber submission which contains [the most updated material regarding Saber](https://github.com/KULeuven-COSIC/SABER)
