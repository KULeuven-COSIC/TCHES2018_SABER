This repository contains the ARM Cortex-M0 and M4 code for SABER implementing the optimizations described in [eprint2018 - 682](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/682.pdf). **Note:** This code is an updated version that introduces little modifications in the rounding algorithm, which lead to small (mostly negligible) differences in the cycle count of the operations with respect to the results reported in the paper.
